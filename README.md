# **An Attention-Enhanced Deep Learning Framework for Multi-Organ Semantic Segmentation in CT Images**

In this work, we propose **OrganSegNet**, a novel deep learning framework incorporating attention mechanisms for multi-organ semantic segmentation of CT images. The dataset comprises 892 training and 143 unlabeled testing samples, with segmentation targets including the liver, kidney, spleen, and pancreas. 

Our architecture leverages encoder-decoder structures augmented with attention blocks to refine feature fusion and enhance organ delineation. To benchmark performance, we compare **OrganSegNet** against **DeepLabV3**, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation model. Quantitative evaluation is based on **recall**, **precision**, and **F1-score** for each organ.

## **Usage Notes**
- The file paths in the notebooks are configured for use on Kaggle.
- To run the codes on other platforms, adapt the paths to your dataset and files.

## **Dataset**
Due to the large size of the dataset, I can provide it by email.
